## Features

## Technology Stack

- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling with glassmorphism effects
- **JavaScript**: Chat functionality and response logic
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for enhanced visual appeal
- **Google Fonts**: IBM Plex Sans and Press Start 2P fonts

## How It Works

The chatbot operates with a simple logic flow:
1. User clicks the chatbot button to open the interface
2. User can select a predefined question or type a custom query
3. The system matches the question against predefined responses
4. It thinks
5. The appropriate response is displayed in the chat

All predefined questions and answers are stored in JavaScript objects, making it easy to extend the chatbot's knowledge base.
